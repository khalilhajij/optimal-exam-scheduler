How to Run the Application:

Frontend:

- Navigate to the my-exam-scheduling-app folder in your integrated terminal.

- Install the required node modules by running:
"npm install"

- Start the application by running:
"npm start"


Backend:
(Ensure you have an MSSQL database set up.)

(Update the application resources file to match your database configuration.) 

(Use the attached CCIS study plan (found in the zip file) to populate the database with the required data.)

(Ensure you have Maven installed and your JDBC setup configured properly.)

Run the backend with the following command:
"mvn spring-boot:run"


Once both the frontend and backend are running, the application should be operational.
